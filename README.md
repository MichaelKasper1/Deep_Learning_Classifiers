# Deep_Learning_Classifiers
This repository contains 3 jupyter notebooks that classify images.

One of the files classifies street digist with an artificial neural network.
Another file classifies street digits with a convolutional neural network.
The last file classifies images of clothing with a convolutional neural network.

The street digit files share the same data set.
