# Deep_Learning_Classifiers
This repository contains 2 jupyter notebooks that classify digits.

One of the files classifies street digist with an artificial neural network.
Another file classifies street digits with a convolutional neural network.

The street digit files share the same data set which is a pre processed and subset SVHN data which has been used by google to improve google maps image recognition software.
